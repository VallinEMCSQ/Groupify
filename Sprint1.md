- What issues your team planned to address
  - Set up the Spotify SDK to be able to play music in the browser
  - Retrieve playlist information and complete authorization flow/user login
  - Gain access to spotify's api and be able to use it.
  - Be able to set up a login for the api to use the credentials of the user.
- Which ones were successfully completed
  - The Spotify SDK was initialized.
  - Retrieve playlist information
  - The api is connected within our main.go file and accesses spotify's methods but only prints to the console. 
- Which ones didn't and why?
  - Although the Spotify SDK is initialized, it is not connected and set up to play music in browser. Also the user interface is extremely simple currently.
    We spent most of our time trying to set up the Spotify SDK to play music, which left the user interface bare. This issue was a little ambitious for the first
    sprint.
  -  we could not complete the user login because the redirected url displays a message saying the client_id parameter is missing, which may indicate a missing value somewhere. 
  - The api is set up, but currently uses our own hardcoded credentials as well as only using hard coded songs or tracks as opposed to user input or requests.
